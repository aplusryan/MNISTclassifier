# MNISTclassifier
Classifier code from Udacity course; classifies 28x28pixel images to number 0-9

This program is "adapted" from this Udacity course: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwio8Nuqn-PuAhVoElkFHXG1CLwQFjAAegQIChAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udacity.com%2Fcourse%2Fdeep-learning-pytorch--ud188&usg=AOvVaw1eUbkeLyyiml9FCXiSHE_e

This program uses the MNIST Dataset of handwritten numbers. It also uses PyTorch in order to compute and such.
